# geometry_and_tracing
Small C library for basic geometry and some ray tracing. \
(Work in progress)

The goal is to provide efficient tools for people wanting to implement a simple ray tracer in C.
Simple objects like spheres, cubes, planes and triangles are priority but CSG (constructive solid geometry) would be ideal.
Any help / criticism is welcome
